Recover GPS:
Simple script that takes the following string format: {X:0 Y:0 Z:0}.
Returns a Vector3D object that can be used within Space Engineers Scripts.

It was designed to allow me to store GPS Locations as a string and recover them.  Initially created for 
my AI Drone script as the script would need to be able to remember GPSlocations between instances of the script

        public Vector3D recoverGPS(string waypoint){      
            string[] coord = waypoint.Split(' ','}','{');  
            
            double x = double.Parse(coord[1].Split(':')[1]);  
            double y = double.Parse(coord[2].Split(':')[1]);  
            double z = double.Parse(coord[3].Split(':')[1]);  
            
            return new Vector3D(x,y,z);   
        }
